# Core Module

This folder contains the **core business logic** for the AzureAutomatioin project.

---

## Purpose

The `core/` directory is designed to be the **single source of truth** for all automation operations related to Azure resources.  
It provides reusable, interface-agnostic logic that can be imported and used by any interface layer, such as:

- Command-line applications (CLI)
- REST APIs (FastAPI)
- CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
- Other automation tools, scripts, or schedulers

The core logic enables programmatic creation and management of Azure infrastructure, making it easy to integrate with automated workflows and deployment pipelines.  
Logs generated by the core modules are in JSON format, making them suitable for ingestion into data lakes, Azure Data Explorer, or other log analytics platforms for monitoring and auditing.

Additionally, every operation is stamped with a unique `trackingId` (for end-to-end traceability across automation and CI/CD systems) and an Azure `correlationId` (for cross-referencing with Azure Activity Logs).  
This greatly enhances troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and compliance auditing.

## Key Principles

- **Reusability:**  
  All logic in this folder is written to be reused by multiple interfaces, ensuring consistent behavior across CLI, API, CI/CD, and any future integrations.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The `core/` module contains only business logic and is not concerned with user interfaces, HTTP endpoints, or command-line parsing.

- **Testability:**  
  By isolating business logic here, it is easier to write unit tests and maintain high code quality.

- **Extensibility:**  
  New interfaces (such as GUIs, schedulers, or additional APIs) can be added to the project by simply importing and using the logic from `core/`.

---

## Usage

- **Do not** put CLI commands, API routes, or user interface code in this folder.
- **Do** import classes and functions from `core/` into your CLI, API, CI/CD scripts, or other interface modules.

## Example Structure

```
core/
├── az_rg_create.py
├── az_rg_checker.py
├── az_vnet_create.py
├── az_vnet_checker.py
└── (other core logic modules)
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep all business logic and Azure operations in this folder.
- Keep interface-specific code (CLI, API, etc.) in their respective folders.
- Write unit tests for core logic to ensure reliability.
- Use the JSON logs for integration with monitoring and analytics platforms.
- Leverage `trackingId` and `correlationId` in logs for robust troubleshooting and traceability.
